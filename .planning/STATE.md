# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-31)

**Core value:** A team member or client can open the platform and immediately see the SEO health of any site — positions, recent changes, pending tasks — without switching between GSC, spreadsheets, and WP admin.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — site-management

## Current Position

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: DataForSEO is primary SERP source; Playwright SERP is low-volume fallback only (<50 req/day)
- Roadmap: `keyword_positions` monthly range partitioning is a hard constraint in Phase 6 first migration
- Roadmap: redbeat required for UI-driven crawl scheduling (Phase 4); schedule stored in PostgreSQL, not Redis-only
- Roadmap: Playwright workers — `WORKER_MAX_TASKS_PER_CHILD=50`, `BrowserContext` closed in `finally`, `crawl` queue concurrency=2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **Phase 5/6 research flag:** DataForSEO API rate limits and batch sizes — validate credits consumption before wiring up volume lookups
- **Phase 5/6 research flag:** GSC `startRow` pagination behaviour for high-traffic sites (2,000+ pages) — verify quota
- **Phase 8 research flag:** Yoast vs RankMath field name differences — detect `seo_plugin` per site before finalising WP service interface
